# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the Resume Relevance Check System to Streamlit Cloud with all the necessary cloud-compatible modifications.

## ✅ Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your project
- Google Gemini API key
- Streamlit Cloud account

## 🔧 Cloud-Compatible Modifications Applied

### 1. **ChromaDB In-Memory Storage**
- Modified `vector_search.py` to use `EphemeralClient()` instead of persistent storage
- Added `use_persistent=False` parameter for cloud environments
- Data persists only during session (suitable for cloud deployment)

### 2. **SQLite In-Memory Database**
- Modified `database.py` to use `:memory:` database instead of file-based storage
- Added `use_memory=True` parameter for cloud environments
- Results stored in memory during session

### 3. **Secure API Key Handling**
- Removed hardcoded API key from `secrets.toml`
- Updated `app.py` to use Streamlit secrets with fallback to environment variables
- API key configured via Streamlit Cloud secrets management

### 4. **Cloud Environment Detection**
- Added automatic detection of cloud environment
- Optimized settings for Streamlit Cloud performance

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
Ensure your GitHub repository contains these files:
```
📁 Your Repository
├── 📄 app.py (main application)
├── 📄 requirements.txt (updated for cloud)
├── 📄 packages.txt (system dependencies)
├── 📁 .streamlit/
│   ├── 📄 config.toml
│   └── 📄 secrets.toml (template)
├── 📄 README.md
└── 📄 ... (other files)
```

### Step 2: Configure Streamlit Secrets
1. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. In the app settings, go to "Secrets"
4. Add your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key-here"
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Application
1. In Streamlit Cloud, select your repository
2. Set the main file path to: `app.py`
3. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for the deployment to complete
2. Test the application with sample data
3. Verify that analysis results are generated correctly

## 🔍 Key Features of Cloud Deployment

### ✅ What's Working
- ✅ Gemini AI integration for intelligent analysis
- ✅ PDF and DOCX text extraction
- ✅ In-memory vector search for semantic matching
- ✅ In-memory database for result storage
- ✅ Batch processing capabilities
- ✅ Export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- ✅ Responsive web interface

### ⚠️ Cloud Limitations & Solutions

#### **Data Persistence**
- **Limitation**: No persistent file storage
- **Solution**: Data stored in session state and memory
- **Impact**: Results available only during session

#### **File Upload Size**
- **Limitation**: 200MB total upload limit
- **Solution**: Configured in `.streamlit/config.toml`
- **Impact**: Large batch uploads may be limited

#### **Memory Usage**
- **Limitation**: Limited RAM per instance
- **Solution**: In-memory storage, efficient processing
- **Impact**: Large datasets may require optimization

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **API Key Not Found**
```
Error: No Gemini API key found
```
**Solution**: Ensure API key is properly set in Streamlit Cloud secrets

#### **Memory Issues**
```
Error: Out of memory
```
**Solution**: Process smaller batches or optimize data handling

#### **Model Loading Issues**
```
Error: Failed to load sentence transformer model
```
**Solution**: Check internet connectivity and package versions

### Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Processing**: Process resumes in smaller batches
2. **Memory Management**: Clear session data when not needed
3. **Caching**: Use Streamlit's caching for expensive operations

## 📊 Testing Your Deployment

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test all components
python test_cloud_ready.py
```

### Cloud Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload single PDF resume
- [ ] Upload single DOCX resume
- [ ] Test batch processing (3-5 files)
- [ ] Verify analysis results are generated
- [ ] Test export functionality
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- ✅ API key stored in Streamlit secrets (not in code)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in repository
- ✅ Environment variable fallback for local development

### Data Privacy
- ✅ Uploaded files processed in memory
- ✅ No permanent file storage
- ✅ Session-based data handling

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Monitor Streamlit Cloud logs for errors
- Check API key validity periodically
- Verify model loading and performance

### Updates
- Update dependencies in `requirements.txt` as needed
- Test changes locally before deploying
- Monitor for Streamlit Cloud platform updates

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Application loads without errors
- ✅ Gemini AI generates varied analysis results
- ✅ File uploads work for PDF and DOCX
- ✅ Batch processing completes successfully
- ✅ Export functionality works
- ✅ Interface is responsive and user-friendly
